    "This collection of Jupyter Notebooks serves as an overview of the materials to study in the Unit.\n",
    "It is used as the basis for lectures and discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials in these notebooks are based on the online book: \n",
    "[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html), a Runestone Interactive Project by Brad Miller and David Ranum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports narrative text, Python executable code, equations and visualizations.\n",
    "You may read the notebook, change and execute the Python code, have your own copy to edit and take notes in the class, and more.\n",

    "## Installing Python and Anaconda on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started with the installation, let’s learn a bit more about what Anaconda exactly is. Python is the programming language which will be installed on the machine and on top of that different independent development environments (IDEs) and packages can be installed. Python on its own is not going to be very useful unless an IDE is installed. This is where Anaconda comes in the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda installs IDEs and several important packages like NumPy, Pandas, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Download the installer from the link below.**\n",

    "**Step 2: Scroll down and select the operating system you are using.  I have selected Windows.**\n",

    "**Step 3: From the Python 3.7 section, choose from 32bit / 64bit options. To determine the correct option, in File Explorer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right click This PC \n",
    "* Select Properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "![properties](images/00/py0.png)\n",

    "* Select the appropriate download\n",
